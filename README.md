This repository contains my implementation of Problem Set II from MIT's 6.0002 course: Computational Thinking and Data Science.

## Implemented So Far

- **`WeightedEdge` Class**: Created a class to represent a weighted directed edge with total distance and outdoor distance.
- **`Digraph` Class**:
  - `add_node`: Method to add a node to the graph.
  - `add_edge`: Method to add a weighted edge between nodes.
- **`load_map` Function**: Parsed a text file and loaded the map into a digraph, testing its functionality.

## Next Steps

- Implement `get_best_path` function using DFS and optimization constraints.
- Analyze performance and edge cases.
- Document results and visualize if necessary.

## Purpose

This project explores directed graphs and optimization problems using weighted paths. It simulates choosing the best route between buildings with constraints like distance and outdoor travel.
